# Tunnel Mode Implementation Summary

This document outlines the changes made to implement Tunnel Mode for the FChat2 application.

## Overview

Tunnel Mode allows users to test the application remotely by:
1. Deploying the backend to a public server
2. Running the frontend using Expo's tunnel feature
3. Connecting to the app from any device, anywhere

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Configuration

#### API Service Updates (`frontend/services/api.js`)
- Added support for environment variables to configure backend URL
- Improved tunnel detection logic
- Enhanced connection fallback mechanisms
- Added logging for connection status

#### Expo Configuration (`frontend/app.config.js`)
- Created a new configuration file to manage environment variables
- Added support for `PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` and `USE_TUNNEL` variables
- Configured the app to detect and use proper connection mode

#### Connection Information (`frontend/connectionInfo.js`)
- Added `tunnelMode` property to track connection mode
- Implemented `isTunnelMode()` helper function
- Updated how IP address detection works

#### UI Updates (`frontend/App.js`)
- Added mode indicator in header showing "Tunnel Mode" or "Direct Mode"
- Improved server status display
- Used `CONNECTION_INFO` to determine current mode

### 2. Backend Configuration

#### CORS Configuration (`backend/src/index.js`)
- Updated to allow connections from Expo domains (`expo.dev`, `expo.io`)
- Added support for mobile app origins
- Implemented strict origin checking for enhanced security

### 3. Environment Configuration

#### Environment Variables (`.env` and `.env.example`)
- Added new variables:
  - `PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`: URL of deployed backend for tunnel mode
  - `USE_TUNNEL`: Flag to enable tunnel mode

#### Updated Start Script (`start.sh`)
- Added `-t` command-line flag to enable tunnel mode
- Enhanced IP detection for local mode
- Added configuration validation
- Improved environment variable handling
- Created appropriate connection files based on mode

### 4. Documentation

#### Main README Updates
- Added section explaining the two running modes
- Provided instructions for both local and tunnel modes
- Updated project structure to include new files

#### Detailed Deployment Guide (`TUNNEL_SETUP.md`)
- Created comprehensive guide for deploying the backend
- Provided multiple deployment options (Render, Railway, Netlify)
- Added security considerations
- Included troubleshooting steps

## How to Use Tunnel Mode

1. Deploy your backend following the instructions in `TUNNEL_SETUP.md`
2. Update your `.env` file with:
   ```
   PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://your-deployed-backend.com
   USE_TUNNEL=true
   ```
3. Start the application in tunnel mode:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh -t
   ```
4. The app will run on Expo's servers and connect to your deployed backend

## Technical Details

### Mode Detection Logic

The application determines it's running in tunnel mode if any of these conditions are met:
1. The `USE_TUNNEL` environment variable is set to `true`
2. The `tunnelMode` property in `connectionInfo.js` is `true`
3. The Expo manifest URL contains `expo.dev` or `expo.io` domains

### Connection Flow

When in tunnel mode:
1. The frontend attempts to connect to the `PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`
2. If that fails, no fallback to local URLs is attempted
3. The UI clearly indicates tunnel mode is active

When in local mode:
1. The app attempts to connect to the most appropriate local URL
2. If connection fails, it tries alternate URLs in sequence
3. The UI shows direct mode is active
